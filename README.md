# MIE1666_RL_Portfolio_Optimization
This is the course project for MIE1666 2024 Fall Team 5: ** Leveraging Transformer in Deep Reinforcement Learning for Portfolio Optimization. **

## Full Report
The full report is available in 

## Folder and explanations:

**ft_val** -> final hyperparameter tuning for the transformer model in the deep reinforcement learning structure 

**final_comparsion** -> Train the transformer with the tuned hyperparameter setting and evaluate it with the test dataset, compare with baseline methods (Fully connected, LSTM, and QP)

**future_work** -> Effort of trying to implement 'future work' mentioned in the slide and report
